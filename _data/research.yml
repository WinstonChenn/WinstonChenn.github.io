    - title: Confidence Estimation for Network Propagation
      descriptions: 
        - content: "Developed a method to compute statistical confidence estimation (q-value) for all network propagation-based prediction algorithm."
        - content: Applied the method on Rankprop, a protein homology prediction algorithm and demonstrated the ability to identify homology with high-precision."
    - title: Error‚Äêcontrolled Interaction Detection in Neural Network
      descriptions: 
        - content: Developed a neural network interpretation method that discovers learned feature interactions at desired error rate.
        - content: Applied the interpretation method on fruit flies (Drosophila) genomics data to identify meaningful transcription factor (TF) interactions.
