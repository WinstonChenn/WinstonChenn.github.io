    - title: Confidence Estimation for Network Propagation
      descriptions: 
        - content: Developed a framework to estimate statistical confidence (q-value) for network propagation-based prediction algorithm.
        - content: Implemented the framework on Rankprop, a network propagation-based protein homology detection algorithm.
        - content: Applied Rankprop and confidence estimation on a large-scale protein database (SCOP) to demonstrate its ability of identifying protein homologies with high-precision.
        - content: "Presented research work at University of Washington's annual undergraduate research symposium."

    - title: "Error-controlled Interaction Detection in Neural Network"
      descriptions: 
        - content: Developed a neural network interpretation method that discovers learned feature interactions at desired error rate.
        - content: Designed and implemented a compute module that debiases the raw interaction interpretation results.
        - content: Applied the interpretation method on fruit flies (Drosophila) genomics data to identify meaningful transcription factor (TF) interactions.
