  link: https://www.ece.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RealNetworks-SDR2HDR-Poster-1.pdf
  time: June 1, 2022
  descriptions:
  - content: "Motivation of this work: developed a real-time SDR to HDR conversion algorithm that can be applied to perform video conversion on the fly."
  - content: "Discussed the two existing approach to perform SDR to HDR and their limitations: 1) Inverse tone mapping(ITM)-based approach (low conversion quality). 2) Deep learning-based approach (too slow for real-time application)"
  - content: "Explained our approach: an improved ITM method that can dynamically estimate the optimal conversion parameters using ML techniques."

  title: Confidence Estimation for Network Propagation-based Biological Studies
  link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ4pvAE1OHg
  time: May. 18, 2021
  descriptions:
  - content: "Intuitively explained the network propagation algorithm: a method that mimic diffusion process to make inference from network data." 
  - content: "Limitation of network propagation: no confidence estimation for its inference results, which can be limiting for biological discovery."
  - content: "Our method: integrating network propagation with the knockoff framework to efficiently estimate confidence level (q-value)."
  - content: "Showcased experiment results of applying network propagation with confidence estimation on protein homology discovery."
